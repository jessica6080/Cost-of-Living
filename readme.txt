Our project focuses on data visualization of the cost of living indices for major
US cities through a very interactive implementation for users. For example, the
program outputs a US map from the inputted dataset to display city points with a
specific color to represent their relative cost of living index compared to other
cities. Additionally, the project also outputs an interactive window that displays
the US map with plotted, color-coded points and involves GUI components like a
dropdown menu that allows users to click on a city from the list and reveal the
city’s data or a button that shows all of the cities’ data when user clicks on it.
Finally, our project implemented an interactive calculator using GUI components
that takes in user input (two state initials and current income), calculates the
percent change in income moving from state 1 to state 2, and calculates the estimated
income needed to maintain their current cost of living standard in state 1 if they
decide to move to state 2.
